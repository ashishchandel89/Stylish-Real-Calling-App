Android Calling App

This is a simple Android calling application developed using Java and Android Studio.
The app allows users to select a contact and directly make a real phone call using the device’s native dialer.
The application is built purely on Android’s intent system without using any third-party libraries. This keeps the app lightweight, fast, and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners learning Android development.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Android handles phone call intents and runtime permissions in a real application scenario.
